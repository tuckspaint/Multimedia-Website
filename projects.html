		<h1>Passion Project</h1>
    <div class="projbox">
      <p>For his Passion Project, Tucker created a timeline of graphic design throughout the 1950s to the 1990s in Illustrator. Each decade involved Tucker researching common design motifs of the time and creating them on his own using mainly the pen tool and the shape tool.

    <h1>Collaborative Project</h1>
    <div class="projbox">
      <p>For his Collaborative Project, Tucker worked with Connor Glasscock to make a parody Twenty One Pilots album cover. The version pictured is the second one they made because the first one was trash. To create it, they mostly just used the pen tool in Illustrator to trace photos and layer them on top of each other.</p>

    <h1>Community Project</h1>
    <div class="projbox">
      <p>For his Community Project, Tucker made an Obama-inspired "Hope" poster for all-school presidential candidate, Philip Canady. He started by taking a photo of Philip and posterizing it in PhotoShop. Then, he imported the posterized photo into Illustrator and traced each layer with the pen tool, and colored each layer using the color scheme from Obama's "Hope" poster. Philip won the election solely because of this poster.</p>

    <h1 id="newlearning">New Learning Project</h1>
    <div class="projbox">
      <p style="width: 100%">The final project Tucker created was his New Learning Project. For this project, Tucker learned CSS and used it to make this super cool and responsive website that you're using right now, using over 500 lines of CSS code.
